This is as simple of an example as available to set up a multiple connection Winsock
Server which you can expand upon to create any type of server (FTP, HTTP, SMTP). I have
created this example with beginners in mind, but it is also well suited for the elite if
they want to trim down thier code a wee bit. I was going to add some file transfer
capabilities, but I will save that for another version. If anyone knows how to setup a
fax server, I would love to hear from ya.
